# Joint Savings Account

## Background

A company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, the creation of a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses will be carried out. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. The smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## What is being created?

- The completed Solidity JointSavings smart contract.

- A folder named Execution_Results that contains at least eight images. These images should confirm that the deposit and withdrawal transactions, which are            designed to test the JointSavings functionality in the JavaScript VM, worked as expected.


## Instructions

- When creating a joint savings contract, a variety of variables were utilised to accept arguments, create if statements or functions, and assist in the creation of a free flowing contract. 

## Step 2: Compile and Deploy Your Contract in the JavaScript VM
